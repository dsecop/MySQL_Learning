# SQL Exercises 
## Why I learn SQL
#### For learning databases :wink:
Every developer should know the basics of SQL - a database language. It is impossible to create any serious application that would not require the storage of information. I work in MySQL an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) because it is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
